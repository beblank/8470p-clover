# 8470p_10.13.x
clover folder with needed fixes for the elitebook 8470p (i5 model) to run high sierra

Simply copy over this clover folder to your install stick ESD / main drive ESD

If you use another CPU you want to remove the SSDT.aml and generate your own. In that case you might need NullCPUPowerManagement to boot


Still to fix:

maybe find a way to get tracking point stick thingy to work correctly
